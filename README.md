# chess_clock
A chess clock is made up of two clocks that are set next to one another and include buttons that let you start one clock while putting a stop to the other, preventing the two clocks from operating simultaneously. In turn-based two-player games like chess and other such games, as well as in some legal settings where each party is granted a set amount of time to present their case, chess clocks are used.
